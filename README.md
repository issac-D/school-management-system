# School Management System short Draft

This Python script using the Tkinter library provides a basic school management system with features for:

* **Student Registration:**
    * Allows the user to enter student name and class.
    * Stores student data (ID, name, class, score, password) in a file ("students.txt").

* **Teacher Registration:**
    * Allows the user to enter teacher name and subject.
    * Generates a unique ID and a random password for each teacher.
    * Stores teacher data (ID, name, subject, password) in a file ("teachers.txt").

* **Parent Page:**
    * Allows parents to view their child's information (name, score, payment status) and comments left by teachers, upon entering their parent ID and assuming a parent-child relationship has been established within the system.

* **Teacher Page:**
    * Allows teachers to update a student's score and leave comments for students by entering the student's ID.
    * Stores comments in a separate file ("messages.txt").

* **Admin Page:**
    * Currently a placeholder with a message upon clicking the button.

* **Registrar Control:**
    * Provides options to:
        * View a list of all registered students.
        * View a list of all registered teachers.
        * Remove a specific student by ID.
        * Remove a specific teacher by ID.

**How to Use:**

1. **Run the script:**
    * Save the code as `school_management.py`.
    * Make sure you have Python and the Tkinter library installed.
    * Run the script from your terminal using the command: `python school_management.py`

2. **User Roles:**
    * The system offers different functionalities depending on the user role selected on the main page.
    * Parents and Students use separate IDs to access their respective pages. 
    * The Registrar role requires a password for access.
    * Admin functionality is currently under development.

**File Structure:**

* `school_management.py`: The main Python script containing the code for the system.
* `students.txt`: File to store student data (ID, name, class, score, password).
* `teachers.txt`: File to store teacher data (ID, name, subject, password).
* `parents.txt`: File to store parent data (ID, name, child_id, payment_status).  **Note:** Parent functionality is not fully implemented in this version.
* `messages.txt`: File to store comments left by teachers for students (message_id, student_id, recipient_id, message_content).

**Note:**

* This is a basic implementation and can be further enhanced by adding features like:
    * Login functionality for all users (students, parents, teachers, registrar, admin).
    * More comprehensive student and parent functionalities.
    * User interface improvements.
* The ID generation and password generation functions (`generate_id` and `generate_password`) are included in this example.
